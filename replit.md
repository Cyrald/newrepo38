# E-Commerce Platform - Natural/Organic Products

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce platform specialized in selling natural and organic products. The application features a React-based frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence. The platform includes comprehensive user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, payment integration, and real-time customer support via WebSocket.

**Security Status:** All critical vulnerabilities from SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md have been addressed as of November 30, 2025.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build Tool:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

**State Management:**
- Zustand for global state management (auth, cart, chat)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and caching
- Custom hooks pattern for reusable data-fetching logic

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Theme system supporting light/dark modes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Problem:** Need for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Solution:** Shadcn/ui provides pre-built, customizable components with accessibility built-in
- **Rationale:** Reduces development time while maintaining design consistency and WCAG compliance

### Backend Architecture

**Core Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript for type-safe API development
- RESTful API design with resource-based routing
- WebSocket server for real-time features (support chat, order notifications)

**Database Layer:**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (via Neon serverless)
- Schema-first design with Zod validation

**Authentication & Security:**
- Session-based authentication using express-session with PostgreSQL store
- bcrypt for password hashing with timing-attack protection
- CSRF protection via double-submit cookie pattern
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Rate limiting on authentication and sensitive endpoints

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Problem:** Need for real-time communication between customers and support staff
- **Solution:** WebSocket server with connection pooling and rate limiting
- **Rationale:** Enables instant messaging without polling overhead; connection limits prevent DoS attacks

- **Problem:** Secure session management across distributed environments
- **Solution:** PostgreSQL-backed session store with secure cookie configuration
- **Rationale:** Sessions persist across server restarts; database-backed storage enables horizontal scaling

### Business Logic Components

**Order Processing Pipeline:**
- Transaction-based order creation with stock validation
- Promocode validation with single-use and temporary types
- Bonus points system (3-10% cashback based on order value)
- Idempotency key mechanism to prevent duplicate order submissions

**Image Processing:**
- Sharp library for server-side image optimization
- Automatic format conversion to WebP for reduced bandwidth
- Size constraints (max 1200x1200px) with quality optimization
- Secure path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks

**Payment Integration:**
- YooKassa webhook handler for payment status updates
- HMAC signature verification for webhook authenticity
- Order status synchronization (pending → paid → processing → shipped → delivered)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Problem:** Users accidentally submitting duplicate orders
- **Solution:** Idempotency-Key header requirement with 24-hour expiry
- **Rationale:** Prevents double-charging while allowing legitimate retries

### Data Retention & Compliance

**Automated Cleanup Scheduler:**
- Deletes support messages older than 37 months (GDPR compliance)
- Anonymizes order data older than 37 months (preserves analytics while removing PII)
- Removes log files older than 120 days

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Problem:** GDPR requires data minimization and retention limits
- **Solution:** Scheduled jobs that automatically purge old personal data
- **Rationale:** Automated compliance reduces manual intervention and legal risk

## Security Hardening (Applied: Nov 30, 2025)

### Critical Fixes

**1. Race Conditions (Orders & Bonuses):**
- Atomic database operations using single UPDATE with WHERE conditions
- Stock decrements verify sufficient quantity in same query
- Bonus deductions check balance atomically
- Generic error messages prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for monitoring (security, not sent to client)

**2. CORS Origin Validation:**
- Strict URL parsing with try-catch for malformed origins
- Whitelisted origins: FRONTEND_URL, REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN
- Allows server-to-server (webhook) requests when Origin absent
- Returns 403 for invalid origins with detailed logging

**3. HTTPS & HSTS Enforcement:**
- HTTP→HTTPS redirect (307 status preserves POST/PUT methods)
- HSTS headers: max-age=31536000, includeSubDomains, preload
- Production-only enforcement via NODE_ENV check
- Trust proxy setting for X-Forwarded-Proto header

**4. WebSocket Security:**
- Session expiration validation on connect (blocks expired sessions)
- Concurrent connection limits: 5 per IP address
- Origin validation (CSRF protection via Upgrade request header)
- Message size limits: 64KB max per message
- Rate limiting: 20 messages per 60 seconds per user
- Proper cleanup on close/error events (prevents IP blocking)

**5. SQL Injection Prevention:**
- Migrated LIKE to Drizzle ORM's parameterized `ilike()` function
- Wildcard search preserved with safe parameter binding
- Case-insensitive search maintained

**6. Path Traversal Protection:**
- Image pipeline validates resolved paths against base directories
- Checks both final and temp paths before write operations
- Logs and rejects suspicious path attempts

**7. Information Disclosure:**
- Generic error messages for promocodes ("Invalid or expired")
- Detailed errors logged server-side only
- No enumeration vectors for valid promocode codes

### Database Schema Security

- Default values enforced via `$defaultFn()` for bonus_balance and stock_quantity
- Application-level validation prevents negative values
- Note: CHECK constraints attempted but not supported by Drizzle ORM builder API

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
